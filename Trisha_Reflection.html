        BEEd IV-A 
    </h6>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 1</h2>
    <p>1.	Among the principles of learning, which one is the most important for you? Substantiate your answer.</p>
    <h5>For me, effective learning starts with clearly defined and high expectations for learning outcomes. In our experience, this has proven to be the most essential principle of teaching. We observed this firsthand during a visit to Inerangan Elementary School. This approach lays the foundation for lessons that are both structured and purposeful. The teacher clearly communicated the lesson objectives so students understood what was expected of them by the end of the session. The clarity of instructions helped students stay focused and engaged, creating a productive and goal-oriented classroom atmosphere. Setting clear expectations not only guides students but also encourages accountability and a drive for excellence.</h5>
    <p>2.	What insight did you learn from the class activities that you have observed?</p>
    <h5>The class activities led to genuine learning, demonstrating that aligning teaching strategies with clearly defined outcomes boosts both student engagement and the effectiveness of learning. At Inerangan Elementary School, the teacher used strategies like group discussions, text analysis, and class presentations to help achieve specific learning goals. A key takeaway was the strong focus on critical thinking and contextual understanding throughout the activities. For example, students were tasked with comparing the functions of the respiratory and circulatory systems and relating them to their personal experiences. This approach highlights the importance of having a clear vision of intended student outcomes, as it provides structure for meaningful learning and ensures that classroom activities are purposeful and goal-oriented.</h5>
    <h4>Answering this activity reminded me that effective teaching is both complex and nuanced process wherein it requires a deep understanding of the learning principles, strong observational skills and an empathy for students to achieved continuous improvement. In order to answer the questions effectively, I had to put myself in their shoes, because we need to understand our students’ perspectives to meet their needs. This activity also about taking abstract learning principles and seeing how they play out in real setting/classroom.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 2</h2>
    <p>1. Would you like to teach in the school environment you just observed/remembered? Why or why not?</p>
    <h5>	For me, no. While the school does offer a more peaceful environment and a serene community 	atmosphere, the absence of key facilities such as a clinic, science laboratory, audiovisual room, 	and home economics room is a significant drawback. These facilities are important not only for 	students but 	also for teachers, as they support a conducive learning and teaching 	environment. Additionally, they provide essential spaces for social interaction and gatherings. 	Having such amenities contributes to the comfort and overall well-being of both students and 	staff. Although the students and teachers are respectful, the presence of having an essential 	facility helps not the school but especially the students to feel more comfortable while 	studying. </h5>
    <p>2. If you are the teacher, how can you make the environment more conducive to learning?</p>
    <h5>To build a supportive and positive learning environment while maintaining order and discipline, I would set clear expectations for students regarding their behavior, discipline, and academic performance. I would use positive reinforcement to acknowledge their efforts through praise or rewards, while also ensuring that consistent consequences are given for any misbehavior. This approach helps students learn from their mistakes and grow. We would encourage collaborative work to strengthen peer relationships and promote learning from one another. Differentiated activities would be implemented to cater to the diverse needs of students. Allowing them to explore their interests and express creativity is also a key strategy. Additionally, incorporating nature, using real-life materials, engaging in outdoor activities, and integrating technology would help capture students' interest and enrich their learning experience.</h5>
    <p>3. How do classroom management impact learning?</p>
    <h5>Effective classroom management fosters a supportive environment that encourages student participation by making them feel comfortable and focused, which in turn boosts their engagement in class activities and tasks. It also promotes collaboration, helping students develop better social skills. Moreover, a well-managed classroom that nurtures a positive learning atmosphere—where students feel respected, valued, treated fairly, and safe—can significantly enhance their motivation to learn, leading to improved academic performance and a stronger drive to reach new goals.</h5>
    <p>4. You are to design a learning environment for your would-be students, how will it look like? Illustrate.</p>
    <h5>Our classroom will be thoughtfully designed to prioritize student comfort and suitability, which can positively influence their learning progress. The space will have sufficient lighting to create a balanced warm and cool ambiance, and proper ventilation will ensure comfort—especially during physical activities that require more energy. Educational posters will be displayed to promote an organized and encouraging environment, helping students feel at ease while also developing their planning and organizational skills. Technology will be integrated into the classroom, giving students access to various digital learning resources. There will also be designated areas for both collaborative and individual work, complete with easy access to art materials. Additionally, a mini library or entertainment corner will be available where students can unwind if they feel overwhelmed. Lastly, students will be encouraged to personalize their lockers, allowing them to express their individuality and fostering a sense of inclusiveness and belonging within a supportive learning environment.</h5>
    <h4>Answering this activity showed that creating a positive and inclusive learning environment goes beyond just maintaining order—it involves understanding and addressing the needs of every student. While a peaceful school setting is valuable, the absence of essential facilities can hinder both teaching and learning. I believe that effective classroom management, clear expectations, and a supportive atmosphere help students feel safe, motivated, and engaged. By integrating technology, outdoor experiences, and opportunities for creativity, I aim to foster a space where students not only learn but thrive. Thoughtful classroom design, combined with empathy and structure, plays a key role in shaping meaningful educational experiences. This activity involves observing and assessing the school's available and accessible facilities and resources. It emphasizes the key aspects of the school environment that support student learning. The next section focuses on identifying facilities that aid the learning process and describes the surrounding community to provide context for the school setting. It also includes observing the teacher's classroom management strategies used to maintain a safe and effective learning environment. The analysis section examines how both the environment and classroom management influence student learning and whether these factors support a conducive learning atmosphere.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 3</h2>
    <p>1.	While you were observing the learners, did you recall your experiences when you were at their age? What similarities or differences do you have with the learners you observed?</p>
    <h5>I’ve observed a strong sense of connection and unity between teachers and their students. After watching various educators use their unique teaching styles, it's clear that even a single word from the 	teacher can prompt an immediate response from the class. This reflects a deep understanding—	students are able to grasp what their teacher means, even with minimal communication. The students also support one another and create a positive, inclusive environment, contributing to the overall harmony and 	cohesion of the classroom. 	These qualities are especially remarkable in diverse 	settings, where mutual support and connection thrive.</h5>
    <p>2.	Think of a teacher you cannot forget for positive or negative reasons. How did she/he or not help you with your needs (physical, emotional, social, and cognitive)? How did it affect you?</p>
    <h5>A key teaching strategy is encouraging students to appreciate their individuality. Since everyone is genetically unique, it's important that students feel empowered to be themselves while also showing respect for others. Echoing the guidance of some of our resource teachers, the classroom teacher plays a crucial role in promoting 	inclusivity. By modeling inclusive behavior, the teacher sets the tone for the entire class to follow. Ultimately, we want our students to recognize that differences are valuable learning opportunities—not just in academics, but in everyday experiences as well. </h5>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 3 (SECOND PART)</h2>
    <p>1. While you were observing the learners, did you recall your experiences when you were at their age? What similarities or differences do you have with the learners you observed?</p>
    <h5>Yes, while observing the learners, I remembered how I used to behave and feel when I was in Grade 6. Like the learners I observed, I was also curious, talkative with my seatmates, and excited to participate in class activities. One big similarity was how learners today enjoy group work and fun classroom activities—just like I did back then. However, one difference I noticed is that students today are more exposed to technology, like using tablets and digital tools, which we didn’t have much access to when I was in Grade 6. They also seem more confident in asking questions and expressing themselves.</h5>
    <p>2. Think of a teacher you cannot forget for positive or negative reasons. How did she/he or not help you with your needs (physical, emotional, social, and cognitive)? How did it affect you?</p>
    <h5>One teacher I will never forget was my Grade 6 adviser, Mrs. Feliciano. She was very kind and supportive, especially when I was having a hard time understanding math. She would stay after class to explain the lessons again in a way that made sense to me. Emotionally, she made me feel safe and seen, especially during times when I was shy or unsure. Socially, she encouraged all of us to be respectful and to help one another, which made our class feel like a family. Because of her, I became more confident in school and learned the importance of kindness and patience. She inspired me to want to become a teacher too.</h5>
    <p>3. Share your other insights here.</p>
    <h5>While observing the class, I came to understand how essential it is for teachers to really know their students—not only in terms of academics, but also their emotions and how they relate to others. Each learner has unique abilities, and as a future teacher, I want to help every student discover and develop their potential. I also learned that good classroom management plays a big role in keeping students engaged and focused, while still making learning enjoyable. This experience taught me that teaching goes beyond delivering lessons—it's also about forming strong connections and trust with the learners.</h5>
    <h4>Answering this activity showed that observing the strong connection between teachers and students highlighted the power of mutual understanding and respect in the classroom. Even subtle cues from teachers were met with immediate, thoughtful responses—demonstrating a deep, trust-based relationship. It was also inspiring to see how students supported one another, creating an inclusive and welcoming environment. These interactions show that effective teaching goes beyond academic instruction it involves modeling empathy, celebrating individuality, and fostering a sense of belonging. In diverse classrooms, such unity becomes even more meaningful, reminding us that our differences are not barriers but bridges to deeper learning and connection. Additionally, this activity highlights the significance of the Professional Education Program’s emphasis on PPST Domain 3: Diversity of Learners. It begins by exploring the learners’ characteristics, needs, interests, and behaviors in a diverse classroom setting, including how they interact with peers. The activity underscores the teacher's role and the impact of classroom relationships, taking into account the students' diverse backgrounds. It further observes the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive needs of students from various age groups and levels. The final focus is on identifying effective strategies to meet these diverse needs, aligning them with the learners’ developmental stages, and discussing the implications for teaching and learning.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 4</h2>
    <P>1. As a pre-service teacher, how do you plan, manage and implement developmentally sequenced teaching and learning process to meet curriculum requirement in varied teaching context? </P>
    <h5> As a pre-service teacher, the first step is to identify and assess the needs of our students. Based on this assessment, we will develop a plan and design strategies tailored to meet those needs. When it comes to creating instructional materials, I will ensure they are aligned with students' interests to capture their attention and encourage active participation, fostering a dynamic and engaging learning environment. Our instructional approach will be student-centered, giving learners the opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. Additionally, we will strive to create a classroom atmosphere that supports effective teaching and learning for everyone.</h5>
    <p>2. How do you set achievable and appropriate learning outcomes which are aligned with learning competencies?</p>
    <h5>When setting learning outcomes, it is important that they are aligned with the required competencies and follow the SMART criteria—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Although this approach is commonly used, it remains a valuable method for developing clear and effective learning goals. Using SMART objectives helps maintain structure and focus, benefiting both teachers and students by enhancing the overall instructional process and creating a more supportive educational setting.</h5>
    <h4>While answering this activity, I realized that as a pre-service teacher, I’ve come to realize that understanding students' needs is the foundation of effective teaching. By assessing those needs, I can design strategies and materials that not only align with the curriculum but also capture students’ interests and promote active participation. Embracing a student-centered approach allows learners to express themselves and take ownership of their learning. Setting SMART learning outcomes ensures that goals are clear, focused, and achievable, creating a structured yet flexible environment where both teaching and learning can thrive. This process is essential in building a classroom that is inclusive, engaging, and responsive to all learners. Inerangan Elementary School uses a variety of assessment methods—such as quizzes, group discussions, and projects—to tailor instruction to the diverse needs of its students. These methods not only evaluate student learning but also serve multiple educational purposes. The most important element is the use of formative assessments, which guide ongoing instruction. Overall, these diverse and effective assessment strategies help create a more dynamic and supportive learning environment.</h4>
