    <h6>CATABAY, STEPHANIE <br>
        BEEd IV-A 
    </h6>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 1</h2>
    <p>1.	Among the principles of learning, which one is the most important for you? Substantiate your answer.</p>
    <h5>For me, the most important principle of learning is that effective learning begins with the setting of clear and high expectations of outcomes. Learning becomes more meaningful when students know what they are expected to achieve. If the objectives are made clear at the beginning of the lesson, the learners will have a sense of direction and purpose. They will understand why they are studying the lesson and what knowledge or skills they should gain after the discussion. When expectations are clearly set, students are more motivated to listen and participate because they know what the teacher is guiding them toward. It also helps them measure their own progress and see if they are meeting the goals of the lesson. On the part of the teacher, stating the objectives serves as a guide in delivering the lesson properly and in choosing strategies that will fit the intended learning outcomes. Therefore, setting clear and high expectations of outcomes is very important because it gives the learners a roadmap for their learning journey and motivates them to reach their full potential. </h5>
    <p>2.	What insight did you learn from the class activities that you have observed?</p>
    <h5>From the class activities that I observed in Grade 4, I learned that students learn best when the teacher gives clear instructions and explains the lesson step by step. The activities focused on individual work, which helped the students think on their own and develop responsibility for their answers. I also noticed that the teacher’s guidance and examples made it easier for the learners to understand the topic. This shows that giving proper guidance and feedback is very important in helping students learn effectively.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I realized how important it is for teachers to have a strong mastery of both content and pedagogy to ensure effective learning. Clear communication and setting learning objectives at the beginning of the lesson helped students understand what they needed to achieve. The teacher’s ability to connect lessons to real-life situations also made learning more meaningful and relevant for the learners. This activity made me realize that teaching is not just about delivering information but it’s about creating an environment where students can think critically, participate actively, and develop confidence in their learning. As a future teacher, I learned that understanding both what to teach and how to teach it effectively is key to helping students succeed.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 2</h2>
    <p>1. Would you like to teach in the school environment you just observed/remembered? Why or why not?</p>
    <h5>Yes, I would like to teach in the school environment i observed because teaching is about helping students learn no matter the situation. It gives me the opportunity to guide them and support their growth despite the limited facilities. Even though the school lacks resources such as a library, counseling room, and science laboratory, I believe that through creativity and resourcefulness. I can still provide quality education to the learners.</h5>
    <p>2. If you are the teacher, how can you make the environment more conducive to learning?</p>
    <h5>If I were a teacher, I would make the environment more conducive to learning by creating a classroom that feels safe, welcoming, and organized. I will make sure the room is clean, well-arranged, and free from distractions so students can focus better. I will also build positive relationships with my learners, showing respect and understanding to make them feel valued and comfortable to express themselves. By using clear instructions, encouraging participation, and providing engaging lessons, I can help maintain students’ interest and motivation. Lastly, I will promote discipline and fairness to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to learn and succeed.</h5>
    <p>3. How do classroom management impact learning?</p>
    <h5>Classroom management has a big impact on learning because when rules are clear and students are disciplined, there is order in the class. This allows more time for teaching and less time for dealing with misbehavior. A well-managed classroom helps students focus, listen, and cooperate better. It also creates a positive atmosphere where students feel safe, respected, and motivated to participate. When the teacher manages the class effectively, students develop good study habits, learn responsibility, and become more engaged in lessons. Good classroom management also helps build mutual trust between the teacher and students, making the learning process smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.</h5>
    <p>4. You are to design a learning environment for your would-be students, how will it look like? Illustrate.</p>
    <h5>If I were to design a learning environment for my future students, it would be clean, bright, and spacious. The classroom would have proper ventilation, well arranged chairs and tables, colorful educational posters, and a small reading corner with books. I would also include a space for group activities where students can work together and learn cooperatively. The environment would be safe, comfortable, and child-friendly, making students excited to learn every day. My classroom would be lively and colorful, yet organized, so that students would feel comfortable, motivated, and inspired to learn.</h5>
    <h4>I observed how the school environment and available facilities greatly influence students’ learning and behavior. Even though some facilities like the science laboratory and counseling room were missing, I realized that a positive atmosphere, cleanliness, and good classroom management can still make the environment conducive to learning. </h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 3</h2>
    <p>1. How did you feel as you observed in the classroom? Did you feel a sense of oneness or unity among the learners, and between the teacher and the learners? </p>
    <h5>I felt happy and interested as I observed the classroom. I saw that the students and the teacher had a good relationship. There was a sense of unity because the learners respected each other and listened when someone was speaking. The teacher also treated the students fairly, which made the classroom peaceful and organized. The teacher also guided them patiently.</h5>
    <p>2. In the future, how would you want the learners in your classroom to interact? How will you, make it happen?</p>
    <h5>In the future, I want the learners in my classroom to interact with respect, cooperation, and teamwork. I will make this happen by giving equal chances for everyone to speak, using group activities to build teamwork, encouraging shy students to participate, and setting clear rules for respectful communication. This way, all students will feel included and confident to share their ideas.</h5>
    <p>3. While you were observing the learners, did you recall your experiences when you were at their age? What similarities or differences do you have with the learners you observed?</p>
    <h5>While observing the learners, I remembered my own school days. Like them, I was curious and enjoyed asking questions. Some of them seem more confident speaking in class than I was at their age. One difference is that I was quieter and hesitant to participate at first, while many learners now are more interactive and expressive. I also noticed that they enjoy learning through visuals and discussions, which reminded me of how I used to get excited when teachers made lessons fun and engaging. Watching them made me realize how much the learning environment and teaching methods have improved over time, helping students become more active and confident learners.</h5>
    <p>4. Think of a teacher you cannot forget for positive or negative reasons. How did she/he or not help you with your needs (physical, emotional, social, and cognitive)? How did it affect you?</p>
    <h5>I remember a teacher who was very patient and encouraging. She always listened to our problems, helped us understand difficult lessons, and treated everyone fairly. She supported our emotional and social needs by being kind and approachable, and our cognitive needs by explaining things clearly and giving us enough practice. Because of her, I felt more confident, comfortable, and motivated to learn. She inspired me to do my best and made me realize the importance of having a caring teacher who believes in their students’ potential. On the other hand, I also remember a teacher who was very strict, which often made me anxious and less confident in class. I was afraid to recite because I thought she might embarrass me in front of everyone if my answer was wrong. This experience made me realize how much a teacher’s attitude can affect a student’s confidence and willingness to participate. It taught me that while discipline is important, showing kindness, patience, and understanding can make a greater difference in helping students grow and feel valued.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I realized that every learner is unique and possesses different strengths, needs, and ways of learning. As I observed the Grade 4 Masunurin class of Ma’am Leah, I saw how diversity was present in the classroom some students learned quickly and actively participated, while others needed more time, guidance, and encouragement. I also noticed how the teacher showed patience and understanding by adjusting her teaching strategies to meet the needs of all learners, ensuring that no one was left behind. This experience made me appreciate the importance of recognizing and respecting individual differences among students.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 4</h2>
    <P>1. As a pre-service teacher, how do you plan, manage and implement developmentally sequenced teaching and learning process to meet curriculum requirement in varied teaching context? </P>
    <h5>As a pre-service teacher, I plan, manage, and implement developmentally sequenced teaching and learning processes by carefully considering the learners’ age, abilities, and interests. I will create lesson plans that follow the curriculum while using strategies suited to their developmental level. I will begin lessons with simple concepts before moving to more complex ones to ensure learners fully understand each step. I will also use a variety of teaching methods such as discussions, visual aids, and hands-on activities to meet different learning styles. In managing the class, I will maintain a positive and organized environment where students feel safe and motivated to learn. I will continuously assess learners’ progress and make necessary adjustments to address their needs and improve learning outcomes.</h5>
    <p>2. How do you set achievable and appropriate learning outcomes which are aligned with learning competencies?</p>
    <h5>I set achievable and appropriate learning outcomes by aligning them with the learning competencies stated in the curriculum guide. I make sure the outcomes are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)  so they match the learners’ developmental level and learning needs. In doing so, I carefully study what knowledge, skills, and values students should develop by the end of the lesson, ensuring that these outcomes reflect both the goals of the curriculum and the real-life applications of learning. Each learning outcome serves as a guide for selecting appropriate teaching strategies, instructional materials, and assessment tools that will help students meet the desired standards. I also consider learners’ interests, backgrounds, and prior knowledge to make the outcomes meaningful and motivating. By providing proper guidance, differentiated instruction, and continuous feedback, I help students reach these goals at their own pace. This way, every lesson becomes purposeful, learner-centered, and connected to their holistic growth and overall educational development.</h5>
    <h4>While doing the activity, I realized how important it is for teachers to align every lesson with the curriculum guide to ensure students meet the intended learning outcomes. I observed that using both ICT and traditional resources makes learning more engaging and understandable for students. I also learned that organizing lessons from simple to complex concepts helps students build knowledge step by step.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 5</h2>
    <p>1. As a millennial would-be teacher, how can the assessment process help you make learning more fun and more meaningful?</p>
    <h5>	     As a millennial would-be teacher, I can make the assessment process more fun and meaningful by using creative and interactive methods. Instead of giving only paper-and-pencil tests, I can use games, group projects, online quizzes, and performance tasks that let students show what they learned in different ways. This will make students enjoy learning and feel that assessment is not just about grades but about discovering what they can do. By connecting the assessments to real-life situations, students will find learning more meaningful and useful.</h5>
    <p> 2. As a future teacher, how can you eliminate fear of assessment to your students?</p>
    <h5>As a future teacher, I can eliminate the fear of assessment among my students by creating a positive, supportive, and encouraging classroom environment where mistakes are viewed as part of the learning process. I will emphasize that assessments are not meant to punish or embarrass them, but to help them recognize their strengths and areas for improvement. Before giving assessments, I will explain the purpose clearly and guide them on what to expect, so they feel more confident and prepared. Providing constructive and gentle feedback instead of focusing only on scores can also help build their confidence. By celebrating progress, offering praise, and encouraging effort, I can help students see assessments as opportunities to grow rather than something to fear.</h5>
    <p>3. If you are the teacher, what solution(s) could you offer to address the challenges in evaluating students’ performance and giving feedbacks? </p>
    <h5>If I am the teacher, I would address the challenges in evaluating students’ performance and giving feedback by being fair, consistent, and understanding. One common challenge is that not all students learn in the same way, so I would use different methods of assessment—such as quizzes, projects, portfolios, and discussions—to capture different strengths and skills. I would also make sure that my feedback is clear, kind, and helpful. Instead of just saying what’s wrong, I will explain how students can improve and recognize what they did well. Time can also be a challenge, so I would use tools like rubrics to make grading faster and more transparent. I will also invite students to reflect on their own learning so they become more responsible and aware of their progress. By doing these things, I can make the evaluation process more balanced, meaningful, and growth-oriented, helping students see assessment as a guide for improvement rather than a judgment.</h5>
    <h4>While answering the activity, I observed that assessment plays a big role in making learning more enjoyable and meaningful when done creatively and fairly. I realized that teachers have the power to turn assessments into opportunities for growth rather than sources of fear. I also learned that giving kind and constructive feedback helps students feel more motivated and confident to improve.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 6</h2>
    <p>1. As a future teacher, how would you establish good school-community collaboration? How can you work well in the community?</p>
    <h5>As a future teacher, I would establish good school-community collaboration by building strong and respectful relationships with parents, local leaders, and other community members. I believe that communication is very important, so I will make sure to always inform the community about school events, programs, and student achievements. I will also listen to their opinions and ideas because they know the needs of the students and the community better. I will join community activities and encourage students to take part as well, so they can see how learning is connected to real life. By being approachable, respectful, and active in both school and community events, I can help build trust and cooperation that will benefit the learners’ growth and education.</h5>
    <p>2. Do you have any advice about how to invite stakeholders to engage in school- community projects/activities?</p>
    <h5>My advice on how to invite stakeholders to engage in school-community projects is to make them feel valued and involved from the start. I would personally reach out to them and explain how their help can make a big difference in the lives of students. It’s important to show them the purpose and benefits of the activity, not just for the school but also for the whole community. I will use clear and friendly communication, maybe through meetings or letters. Also, I will make sure to give recognition and appreciation to their efforts, so they feel encouraged to participate again. When stakeholders see that their time and support are appreciated, they will be more willing to join future projects.</h5>
    <p>3. In the future, how will you enhance your personal and professional development?</p>
    <h5>In the future, I will enhance my personal and professional development by continuing to learn and improve my teaching skills. I will to attend seminars and training that will help me become a better educator. I will also read books, do research, and keep myself updated on new teaching methods and technologies. Personally, I will work on developing my patience, communication, and leadership skills because these are important in dealing with students and other people. I will also reflect on my teaching experiences to find ways to do better next time. By being open to learning and growth, I can become a teacher who not only teaches well but also inspires students to love learning.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I realized how important it is for teachers to build strong connections with the community and continuously develop both personally and professionally. I observed that being a teacher is not only about teaching lessons inside the classroom but also about serving as a role model, community leader, and agent of change. Teachers who engage with parents, stakeholders, and the wider community create a supportive environment that enhances students’ learning and growth. I also learned that effective teaching requires patience, creativity, professionalism, and lifelong learning. This activity made me realize that as a future teacher, I must build meaningful partnerships with the community, uphold professionalism, and continue improving my skills to better serve my students and society.</h4>
