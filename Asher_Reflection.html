        BEEd IV-A 
    </h6>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 1</h2>
    <p>1.	Among the principles of learning, which one is the most important for you? Substantiate your answer.</p>
    <h5>For me, the most important principle of learning is that learning is an active process. As what I have observed in grade 6 students they learn best when they are directly involved in activities that allow them to explore, ask questions, and apply what they learn in real-life situations. Active learning encourages deeper understanding and helps learners retain knowledge longer because they experience and construct meaning on their own.</h5>
    <p>2.	What insight did you learn from the class activities that you have observed?</p>
    <h5>From the class activities I observed, I learned that effective teaching requires creativity and flexibility. A teacher must use different strategies to address the learners’ needs and interests. I also realized that students are more engaged when the lessons are connected to their daily lives, making learning more meaningful and enjoyable.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I realized that teaching is not just about delivering lessons but about creating meaningful experiences that help learners connect knowledge with real-life situations. A good teacher knows how to apply various learning principles and strategies to make students active participants in their learning journey.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 2</h2>
    <p>1. Would you like to teach in the school environment you just observed/remembered? Why or why not?</p>
    <h5>Yes, I would like to teach in that school environment because it promotes order, respect, and active learning. The classrooms are well-organized, and the students show interest and participation during lessons. It’s a positive environment where both teachers and learners feel comfortable and motivated to achieve their goals.</h5>
    <p>2. If you are the teacher, how can you make the environment more conducive to learning?</p>
    <h5>I would make the environment more conducive to learning by maintaining cleanliness, ensuring safety, and fostering respect among learners. I would also use interactive activities, display educational materials, and create a warm and welcoming atmosphere where students feel free to express their ideas and participate actively.</h5>
    <p>3. How do classroom management impact learning?</p>
    <h5>Classroom management has a great impact on learning because it sets the tone for discipline, focus, and collaboration. When rules and routines are clear, students know what is expected of them, which minimizes distractions and allows more time for meaningful learning. A well-managed classroom also builds a sense of responsibility and respect among students.</h5>
    <p>4. You are to design a learning environment for your would-be students, how will it look like? Illustrate.</p>
    <h5>My ideal learning environment would be bright, organized, and filled with learning materials. Desks would be arranged to encourage group activities and discussions. There would be colorful bulletin boards displaying student works, and a small reading corner to promote a love for learning. The atmosphere would be positive and inclusive, where every student feels safe, valued, and inspired.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I realized that a well-managed and positive learning environment greatly influences students’ behavior, motivation, and performance. A teacher plays a vital role in shaping this environment by maintaining order, showing empathy, and encouraging participation. Creating an ideal classroom means balancing structure with creativity to ensure that every learner can thrive academically and emotionally.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 3</h2>
    <p>1. How did you feel as you observed in the classroom? Did you feel a sense of oneness or unity among the learners, and between the teacher and the learners? </p>
    <h5>As I observed in the classroom, I felt a sense of unity and cooperation among the learners and the teacher. The students showed respect and willingness to help one another, while the teacher encouraged teamwork and inclusiveness. It was inspiring to see how the teacher managed to create a positive atmosphere where every learner felt accepted and supported despite their individual differences.</h5>
    <p>2. In the future, how would you want the learners in your classroom to interact? How will you, make it happen?</p>
    <h5>In the future, I want my learners to interact with respect, collaboration, and empathy. I want them to appreciate one another’s strengths and support each other’s weaknesses. To make it happen, I will promote group activities, open discussions, and peer learning. I will also establish classroom rules that encourage kindness, active listening, and equal participation for all students.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I learned that diversity in the classroom should be seen as a strength rather than a challenge. Each learner brings unique abilities and perspectives that can enrich the learning experience. As a future teacher, it is important to create an inclusive environment where every student feels valued and capable of contributing. Promoting respect, understanding, and collaboration will help build a classroom community that grows together.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 4</h2>
    <P>1. As a pre-service teacher, how do you plan, manage and implement developmentally sequenced teaching and learning process to meet curriculum requirement in varied teaching context? </P>
    <h5>I will base my lessons on the curriculum guide and organize them from simple to complex. I will use strategies that match my students’ abilities and include both digital and traditional materials to make the lesson engaging and easy to understand.</h5>
    <p>2. How do you set achievable and appropriate learning outcomes which are aligned with learning competencies?</p>
    <h5>I will create learning outcomes based on the specific competencies in the K–12 curriculum. I’ll make sure that they are realistic, measurable, and suitable for my students’ level so that everyone can achieve success in learning.</h5>
    <p>3.	How do you plan, manage, and implement developmentally sequenced teaching and learning process to meet curriculum requirements and varied teaching contexts?</p>
    <h5>I plan by studying the curriculum guide and setting lessons that progress from simple to complex concepts. I will manage the process by preparing strategies, activities, and materials that fit the learners’ abilities and environment. During implementation, I guide my students step by step, giving them opportunities to explore, practice, and apply what they learned in real-life situation.</h5>
    <h4>This activity helped me understand the importance of aligning lessons with the curriculum and organizing them from simple to complex. I learned that using both ICT and traditional resources makes learning more engaging and effective. It also reminded me that good planning and adaptability are essential for achieving meaningful learning outcomes.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 5</h2>
    <p>1. As a millennial would-be teacher, how can the assessment process help you make learning more fun and more meaningful?</p>
    <h5>By using creative activities such as ratio games, visual aids, and real-life applications like cooking or budgeting, I can make the assessment process both fun and meaningful for students.</h5>
    <p>2. As a future teacher, how can you eliminate fear of assessment to your students?</p>
    <h5>I would encourage students to see assessments as learning opportunities, not punishments. Giving positive feedback, allowing retakes, and celebrating small improvements can lessen their anxiety.</h5>
    <p>3. If you are the teacher, what solution(s) could you offer to address the challenges in evaluating students’ performance and giving feedbacks? </p>
    <h5>I would use organized record sheets or digital grading tools, prepare clear rubrics, and provide quick feedback after each quiz or activity.</h5>
    <p>4.	If you are the teacher, how do you formulate a plan for your assessment tools in an online platform teaching?</p>
    <h5>I would use online quizzes through Google Forms, digital worksheets for solving ratios, and virtual group tasks like creating a slideshow on ratio applications. I would also provide immediate feedback through comments or chat.</h5>
    <h4>Through this activity, I learned that assessment plays a vital role in improving both teaching and learning. In teaching ratio, the use of quizzes, performance tasks, and real-life applications helped make lessons more meaningful. I realized that assessment is not just about giving grades but also about guiding learners to understand their progress and build confidence.</h4>
    <h2>ACTIVITY 6</h2>
    <p>1. As a future teacher, how would you establish good school-community collaboration? How can you work well in the community?</p>
    <h5>As a future teacher, I would establish good school-community collaboration by maintaining open communication and building trust with parents, local leaders, and other stakeholders. I would participate in community activities, listen to their concerns, and involve them in school programs that promote students’ growth. Working well in the community means showing respect, understanding local values, and being a role model who inspires cooperation for the benefit of learners.</h5>
    <p>2. Do you have any advice about how to invite stakeholders to engage in school- community projects/activities?</p>
    <h5>My advice is to create meaningful and inclusive projects that address the needs and interests of the community. It is important to communicate the purpose and benefits clearly, recognize their contributions, and make them feel valued. Building partnerships through transparency, appreciation, and consistent involvement encourages stakeholders to actively participate in school and community programs.</h5>
    <p>3. In the future, how will you enhance your personal and professional development?</p>
    <h5>I will enhance my personal and professional development by continuously learning through seminars, training, and self-study. I plan to engage in reflective practice to improve my teaching strategies and interpersonal skills. Staying updated with educational trends and collaborating with other educators will help me grow into a more effective and compassionate teacher.</h5>
    <h4>This activity helped me realize that teachers play a vital role not only inside the classroom but also in the community. Building strong school-community relationships fosters a supportive environment for students to learn and thrive. As a future educator, I understand that collaboration, communication, and continuous self-improvement are key to becoming an effective teacher who contributes meaningfully to both education and community development.</h4>
